E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard

Interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw sales data into actionable business intelligence

🎯 The Problem
Online retailers struggle with:

Hidden profit leaks - Products with high revenue but razor-thin margins
Wasted marketing spend - Can't see which channels actually drive profitable sales
Dead inventory - Products sitting unsold for months, tying up capital
Missed opportunities - Don't know when/where customers convert best

Result: 30-40% of potential profit left on the table.
✨ The Solution
An automated analytics dashboard that instantly identifies:
✅ Profit killers - High-revenue products that actually lose money
✅ Marketing waste - Channels with poor ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
✅ Hidden patterns - When and where customers convert best
✅ Inventory issues - Stock alerts and slow-moving products
✅ Growth opportunities - Underutilized high-performing channels
